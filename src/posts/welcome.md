You’ll find this post in your `post` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `npm start`, which launches a web server and
auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `posts` directory that includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
